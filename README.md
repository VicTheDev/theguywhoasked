# TheGuyWhoAsked
This discord bot is the guy who asked. Y'know everytime someone says *"who asked?*, well, it's him, he asked, and he will tell them.
<h2>How to install</h1>
1. Clone or download the repository
2. While in the bot folder, install dependencies by running `npm i` (You must have node and npm installed)
3. Create a `config.json` file and fill it like this:

```json 
{
  "token":"Put your bot token here",
}
``` 
      
4. That's it! Run the `index.js` file to start the bot!
